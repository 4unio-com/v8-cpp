# v8-cpp
C++11 library for binding C++ to JavaScript via the Google V8 engine

V8-cpp abstracts the complexity of V8 behind a simple API that allows you to create V8 modules (shared libraries). These modules can then be loaded into and used from a V8 instance such as (but not limited to) Node.js, io.js, and v8runner (included in this project).
